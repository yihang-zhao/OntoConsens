// silence finalizes it (see useModeratorAudio's onFinalize) -- it is never
// replaced by a separately-transcribed version. It only exists once there
// is actual recognized text to show -- no separate "someone is speaking"
// indicator or animation of any kind.
// Memoized: with multiple speakers active at once, each one's caption
// updates on its own throttled cadence (see CAPTION_SEND_INTERVAL_MS in
// useModeratorAudio.ts) and triggers a state update in the parent's
// liveCaptions map. Without memoizing, that re-renders every OTHER
// speaker's bubble and the entire persisted message list too, even though
// their props didn't change -- multiplying the render cost by however many
// people are talking. Memoizing means only the bubble whose own caption
// text actually changed re-renders.
