          of that panel's mic-toggle footer, so the last step's bottom
          lines up with the bottom of the microphone toggle. The gaps
          between steps are the flex-1 spacer divs below (holding the

          most browsers once content is taller than it (the "centered
          overflow" trap). Making the outer div a plain block scroll
          container, with an inner flex container that's only as tall as
          its own content (min-h-full, not h-full), sidesteps that --
          justify-center still centers the steps when there's extra room,
          but once content overflows the inner flex box just sizes to fit
          it exactly (nothing left to center), so normal top-to-bottom
          scrolling reaches every step including the first. */}
